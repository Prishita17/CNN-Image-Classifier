# CNN Image Classifier (Fashion MNIST / CIFAR-10)

## 📌 Objective
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images into categories 
(e.g., clothes, shoes, bags, or CIFAR-10 objects).  
It demonstrates the basics of computer vision using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📊 Dataset
- Fashion-MNIST (70,000 grayscale clothing images)  
- CIFAR-10 (60,000 color images of 10 object classes)  
- Both are built-in datasets in TensorFlow/Keras.

## ⚙️ Methods
- Preprocessing: normalization of pixel values  
- Model: CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy  

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved 88% accuracy on test dataset  
- Loss and accuracy graphs are in results folder
